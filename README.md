- 👋 Hi, This is a profile written by @heydojo
- 👀 I’m interested in using Gitlab instead of Github!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning why I left Github and moved all my repositories to Gitlab.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate.
- 📫 I'm here for code not social so you shouldn't need to try to contact me.
